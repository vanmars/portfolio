          <p class="lead smaller-text">When a new cohort of students begain their coding journeys, I volunteered to serve as a mentor to three lower cohort students. I thought this would be a good way to give back. I didn't realize how helpful this relationship would be for my own confidence and motivation.</p>
          <p class="lead smaller-text">I've always liked the quote by Brett Farve about wanting to be the person others want in the foxhole with them. I like the idea of having people seek me out when times are tough because they know I can remain calm and alert under pressure. I want to be the kind of person people rely on. with my mentees, I enjoy being someone they can voice their frustrations and worries and dreams to. I enjoy answering their questions, giving them a bigger picture perspective, alert them to things on the horizon, and offering my opinion about how best to make it through the program. It reminds me of how much I have grown in the program, and it also helps me to get out of my own head. One of the best pieces of advice I ever recieved was when you feel low, go help someone out. There's a way in which your problems fade into the background when you help others. I love that an act of service can actually be about elevating all parties involved.</p>
          <p class="lead smaller-text">So mentorship: 10/10 recommend.</p>

          <p class="lead smaller-text">So . . . I've been getting into tech podcasts . . . and I love it!</p>
          <p class="lead smaller-text">I decided this week to listen to a podcast each day during lunch as a way to continue my professional development and to stay on top ot tech trends.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="lead smaller-text"><b>For Design</b>: 99% Invisible</p>
          <p class="lead smaller-text"><b>For EdTech</b>: Ed Influencers</p>
          <p class="lead smaller-text"><b>For Development</b>: Developer's Tea, Code[ish], Code Newbie</p>
          <br>
          <p class="lead smaller-text">I really like this method of Prof Dev. It involved me sitting in the sun while eating lunch and giving my eyes a break from a screen, while the podcast played in the backgroun and ignited my curiosity. I was particularly taken this week with a Developer's Tea Podcast that included an interview with author and former nuclear submarine commander David Marquet. On the program, Marquet talks about the way our language is steeped in compliance, rather than collaboration language. He argues that an effective team is one that encourages curiosity and information sharing and consequently leads to shared leadership at all levels. While decision making must rest in the hands of a single leader (Marquet argues people make decisions not groups of people), the leader makes better decisions when they have access to the knowledge and information of the people on the ground.</p>
          <p class="lead smaller-text">One big takeaway is that binary questions are no good. They preclude the possibility of rich information sharing. Rather, as a member of a team and as a leader, I should be askign questions that ask for responders to give their opinion on a scale, like 'How confident are you in the launch of our app; what % success rate do think it would have if we were to launch today; as opposed to: are we ready to launch (yes or no), or are we all on the same page (yes or no).</p>

          </h3>
          <hr>
          <p class="lead smaller-text">This week, I was able to meet with two mentors. The first was a previous college professor with connections in the EdTech field; the second, a student in the upper cohort of my coding bootcamp. It just so happened that the career services center at Epicodus also organized a lunch meeting to host a panel of previous Epicodus students who had just completed their internships and were beginning work at jobs they had successfully obtained. So it was a big week for thinking about the future!</p>
          <p class="lead smaller-text">I was glad I took the time to meet with them. I knew that I would need to hustle on my own to network and to work outside of my bootcamp course work to ensure I have a successful job search. I'm realizing, though, that I could be doing more to prepare. I definitely need to be taking whiteboarding and mock interviewering more seriously as these are core parts of the interview process, and it takes practice to become good at them. I also need to be studying algorithms and data structures. It sounds like my bootcamp won't cover those topics . . .</p>
          <p class="lead smaller-text">Another benefit to this week: I learned about some useful resources:</p>
          <ul class="lead smaller-text">
            <li>For whiteboarding practice: Code Warriors, Edabit</li>
            <li>For interview prep: Leetcode, Interview Cake</li>
            <li>For algorithms/data structure learning: Udemy offers a course; Leetcode and Interview Cake also seem to offer curricula</li>

          </h3>
          <hr>
          <p class="lead smaller-text">I worked this week with four other bootcamp students to create a text-based adventure game as part of a JavaScript capstone project, and I learned a lot . . .</p>
          <ul class="lead smaller-text">
            <li><b>Articulate when you are feeling stressed</b>: There are always going to be moments of frustration. When you keep your feelings to yourself, though, it keeps you bottled up and it leaves your teammates unable to help. I was impressed when a teammate stated one day, "I have to say I am feelings frustrated because . . ." and then he explained what was happening that was causing him to shut down. Quickly, another teammate and I were able to come to his aid, acknowledge his concerns, apologize where necessary for our own shortcomings, and realize, ultimately, that we all need to be more sensitive to one another's feelings. Seeing this unfold gave me the confidence later when a canvas map that I had built was not working with our webpack to also share my feelings of frustration. A teammate asked if I would like to work on fixing the error, and I felt comfortable, saying, "Honestly, no. I'm frustrated with this whole map and want to step away." He sensed my feeling of depletion and was quick to say compliment the map and assure me it was an important feature that should be included before then offering to attack it together with him taking the lead. I'm realizing the simple phrase "I'm growing frustrated because . . ." is a powerful one because it brings your teammates toward you.</li>
            <li><b>Acknowledge people's work and contributions regularly!!!</b> We all need to know our work is valuable.</li>
            <li><b>Ask people what they want to work on:</b> when you like what you do, you create better products.</li>
            <li>When confronted with conflict, be very aware of when you are being defensive. When in doubt, <b>your first response should be to listen</b> and then apologize if necessary.</li>
            <li><b>Know your goals</b>: My first job in the project was to work on connecting back end elements with front end elements. Early on in the project, I though my job also meant letting the back-end programmer know where their code could be made more efficient. This did not go down very well as it only served to de-motivate the back end programmar and ultimately slow down work. I had to realize my goal for this project week was to learn about team work and workflow, to have a working product at the end of the week that I was proud of, and to learn a little more about rpg game design. The goal was not to have the most lean and efficient code; it was to get the code work and the team working at its greatest potential, so being a stickler for how someone else was solving a problem was actually harmful to the project.</li>

          </h3>
          <hr>
          <p class="lead smaller-text">Programming is addictive. Like a well-made video game, it presents you with multiple problems that are challenging and yet achievable. I find I can stay for very long hours in front of my computer. I know, however, that getting up to take breaks, hydrate, get outside, grab a healthy snack are all activities that actually make me more productive. I am noticing that it is trick to take those breaks, when you are in the middle of debugging something.</p><br>
          <p class="lead smaller-text">Another student from the upper cohort made the comment that you need to learn to put a stopper on what she deems, "Tutorial Hell," the phenomenon of researching a programming method you don't know to disover a tutorial, which contains more information you don't know, which leads you to more and more tutorials. While this can be addictive, it can also be time consuming and time distorting, and so  it quickly becomes difficult to know you need a break, or better yet, that you need to retire for the day. I am still figuring out the right balance here. I think remembering that my family, my breaks, and my free time spent doing non-coding related activities make me more efficient, more interesting, and more in line with my value. I'll need to continue to practice good self-monitoring to know when I am slipping into Tutorial Hell and will need some good positive self-talk to remind myself of my priorities.</p>

          <hr>
          <p class="lead smaller-text">This week as we dove into object-oriented programming with its constructors and prototypes and JS event listeners nested in different layers of UI logic represented a clear departure from previous weeks, where I generally knew the content from prior programming courses. There were moments of frustation, feeling overwhelmed, and moments where I felt belittled by my pair (although that might be a whole different blog post topic). But after finishing the week and realizing I was able to research and review to stay on top of my work, gave me a special kind of confidence. Not the confidence from having done something that you are skilled at well, but the confidence that comes from doing something that you are not skilled at pretty decently.</p><br>
          <p class="lead smaller-text">I hear programmers talk about this as getting comfortable with getting uncomfortable. I used to hear that saying and immediately rebuff it, thinking the issuer of those lines was simply not being appropriately critical of the teaching environment that was allowing confusion to occur unncessarily. I still think some classrooms do this, but I am beginning to see how getting comfortable with the uncomfortable, or, in my case, feeling frustrated by inefficiences and seemingly slow progress, actually allows me to reap certain benefits. It became a kind of challenge for me this week to see how I could re-frame a low point into a useful, learning point. If I hadn't struggled with challenging tasks and challenging teammates, I would have not have spent nearly as much time on the problem. And I am getting the sense that it is time, deeply focused time, spent with a problem allows us to know it inside and out, and so gives us more power over it.</p><br>
          <p>I think I am a convert to the comfortable-with-the-uncomfortable camp.</p>

          <p class="lead smaller-text">I spoke with a student from the upper cohort--an activity, I highly recommend to other bootcampt students. He shared a lot of advice, one of them being, to treat your practice exercises as the notes they will inevitably become. He said to comment the heck out your practice exercises, so that when you go back to them for help with other projects, you can more easily use them. This made me think about all the extra challenges I have taken on in the past few Friday projects I have had for Epicodus. I thought that adding in little CSS or Bootstrap flourishes were a way to keep extending the project, once I had completed the main objective. Now, I am realizing that all the extra experimentation will pay off in future work. So I am motivated to try out new things even more. I am finding getting over the initial hurtle of experiencing something new allows me to better engage with and embrace that newness. Too often, we fear the unknown and so avoid experiencing it. I am all for jumping in! You can keep the jump a small or quick one, but getting used to the water, even if only momentatily, makes it whole lot easier to dive back in later.</p>

          <hr>
          <p class="lead smaller-text">I've started listening to the podcast 'Effectively Human,' hosted by PolarNotion CEO Morgan Lopes. Morgan presented a fantastic talk to our cohort on learning, networking, and interviewing as a junior developer, so I was eager to check out his podcast. In the episode, "The Curse of Knowledge," guest host Alie Heenan, a software product manager, discussed how knowledge of a specialized topic can be a curse when communicating with those with less knowledge because knowledge can make us unaware of when we speaking over the heads of those we are attempting to connect with. Heenan cites a Brene Brown quotation: "Clear is kind. Unclear is unkind." This got me wondering: <b>while pair programming, what can I do to be clear and what can I do to become aware when I am being unclear?</b></p>
          <ul>Ways to Be More Clear</ul>
            <li class="lead smaller-text">When partnering with someone for the first time, go over preferences regarding taking breaks, switching drivers, reading lessons/exercises aloud or silently</li>
            <li class="lead smaller-text">Like at Starbucks, you start with the size of your drink, start comments about code with a specific line number, and use proper terminology to describe what you are talking about.</li>
            <li class="lead smaller-text">When using specialized vocabulary, consider whether you need to define the term.</li>
            <li class="lead smaller-text">When seeking clarity from another, use the sentence starter: "Help me to better understand . . .</li>
            <li class="lead smaller-text">When a pair finds a bug or type in your code, responding with "Good catch!" or something similar is helpful because it shows you don't go on the defensive and that you want them to hear their input, not to mention, you want them to catch your errors as you code.</li>

            <ul>Ways to Become More Aware</ul>
            <li class="lead smaller-text">Engage in perspective taking regularly. While driving and/or answering a question in particular, be cognizant of how your partner is attempting to follow along with something knew.</li>
            <li class="lead smaller-text">Be hyper vigilant against falling into SILENT MODE. If you are stuck while driving, communicate what precisely you are struggling with. Try forming a question to show your partner how they can help. If you navigate to another screen to do research, share what you plan to do with your pair and suggest activites they can do while they wait for you.</li>

          As Carol Dweck explains in her 2016 article <a href="http://thebusinessleadership.academy/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/What-Having-a-Growth-Mindset-Means.pdf">What Having a 'Growth Mindset' Actually Means</a>: "Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). This is because they worry less about looking smart and they put more energy into learning."

          <span class="underline">Self-Reflection Questions: </span>
          <br>
          <ul class="lead smaller-text">
            <li>When, like all developers, I encounter a problem I can't immediately solve, what's my internal reaction? Is it along the lines of, "Oh, I'm not smart enough for this," or more like, "Okay, I just need to learn more."?</li>
            <br>
            <p>My first reaction is actually to get excited by the difficulty of the problem because I know it will feel good to figure out the progblem. I know that if I am unsure how to solve something I have a lot of resources I can utilize to learn.</p>
            <li>Be honest, what do I value and praise myself for more? Innately/already knowing how to solve a problem? Or being able to stick with it, research, troubleshoot, and learn more to debug?</li>
            <br>
            <p>I think there is more satisfaction in figuring out a problem that I have not solved before than knowing how to solve a problem because I have already solved it. It is satisfying to know the larger logic behind what I need to do to solve a problem I haven't solved before. But Id on't think, at the end of the day, I'm interested in tallying up how many of the same problems I can solve. I would gt bored. I am always interested in taking on more challenges or improving what I am already doing with a new more effective method.</p>
            <li>Do I have a growth mindset? Why or why not?</li>
            <br>
            <p>I think being a teacher, who taught others about growth mindset and saw the results when students bought into the endless possibilities of their own growth, has made it easy to embrace a growth mindset. Where I perhpas feel pressure is when I think about the skills I need to be able to contribute to a company in a junior developer position. I want to get to that level quickly and so feel anxious to learn as much as I can each and every day. I can get frustrated when I feel like I am not maximing out my learning in a day. </p>
            <li>What can I do to maximize my growth mindset?</li>
            <br>
            <p>Remembering to be grateful for everything I can do in a day helps. Taking breaks and walking away from coding projects for a bit to spend time with my family has also been important. I can get excited about a coding problem and stay up late into the early hours of the morning. But I've found that leaves me tired and less productive the next day.</p>
