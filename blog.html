          As Carol Dweck explains in her 2016 article <a href="http://thebusinessleadership.academy/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/What-Having-a-Growth-Mindset-Means.pdf">What Having a 'Growth Mindset' Actually Means</a>:"Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). This is because they worry less about looking smart and they put more energy into learning."

          <span class="underline">Self-Reflection Questions: </span>
          <br>
          <ul class="lead smaller-text">
            <li>When, like all developers, I encounter a problem I can't immediately solve, what's my internal reaction? Is it along the lines of, "Oh, I'm not smart enough for this," or more like, "Okay, I just need to learn more."?</li>
            <br>
            <p>My first reaction is actually to get excited by the difficulty of the problem because I know it will feel good to figure out the progblem. I know that if I am unsure how to solve something I have a lot of resources I can utilize to learn.</p>
            <li>Be honest, what do I value and praise myself for more? Innately/already knowing how to solve a problem? Or being able to stick with it, research, troubleshoot, and learn more to debug?</li>
            <br>
            <p>I think there is more satisfaction in figuring out a problem that I have not solved before than knowing how to solve a problem because I have already solved it. It is satisfying to know the larger logic behind what I need to do to solve a problem I haven't solved before. But Id on't think, at the end of the day, I'm interested in tallying up how many of the same problems I can solve. I would gt bored. I am always interested in taking on more challenges or improving what I am already doing with a new more effective method.</p>
            <li>Do I have a growth mindset? Why or why not?</li>
            <br>
            <p>I think being a teacher, who taught others about growth mindset and saw the results when students bought into the endless possibilities of their own growth, has made it easy to embrace a growth mindset. Where I perhpas feel pressure is when I think about the skills I need to be able to contribute to a company in a junior developer position. I want to get to that level quickly and so feel anxious to learn as much as I can each and every day. I can get frustrated when I feel like I am not maximing out my learning in a day. </p>
            <li>What can I do to maximize my growth mindset?</li>
            <br>
            <p>Remembering to be grateful for everything I can do in a day helps. Taking breaks and walking away from coding projects for a bit to spend time with my family has also been important. I can get excited about a coding problem and stay up late into the early hours of the morning. But I've found that leaves me tired and less productive the next day.</p>
