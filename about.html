          <h3 class="card-title">About Me</h3>
          <h6 class="card-subtitle text-muted">Background</h6><br>
          <p class="card-text">I believe writing helps us understand ourselves and our world, our values and our 
            purpose, and in so doing enables us to become agentive selves capable of pursuing a 
            well-lived life.</p>
          <p class="card-text">For five years, I had the gift of sharing this power of writing and reading with middle
            and high school English students. And I loved it! But there was something missing.</p>
          <p class="card-text">Owed in large part to my training at Columbia's Teachers' College, I always saw myself 
            as a both a teacher and a researcher of my craft. Yet, the reality of teaching left 
            little time for the kind of research that would sate my curiosity.</p>
          <p class="card-text">So I returned to graduate school, choosing Northwestern, the epicenter of studies in 
            the Learning Sciences, to study research on design and learning. I was interested in 
            how we could leverage technology to engage students in richer learning experiences and 
            to free up teachers so that relationships, rather than paperwork, could be the focus of 
            their attention.</p>
          <p class="card-text">As with any good learning experience, my thinking expanded and my learning trajectory 
            altered multiple times while at Northwestern. After taking a course in Python, I realized 
            that I had a developed a love for programming! I enjoyed working on a problem patiently,
            paying attention to all its fine details, and experiencing that hard-won feeling of contentent
            when all your efforts pay off in a useful and innovative final product. I ended up signing up
            for a course in Web the following quarter. </p>
          <p class="card-text">After completing my master's program, I knew I wanted to continue creating and building up 
            my programming skills. I enrolled in Epicodus's full-time coding school in August to fill 
            in the gaps I need in order to be a junior developer.</p>
          <p class="card-text">By next year, I hope to find work with an EdTech company, who shares my mission to 
            create social, relevant, and playful learning experiences. I think being a programmer 
            with a learning sciences background will help me contribute in unique and meaningful ways.</p>
